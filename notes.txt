should probably remove the 'continue's, they do nothing. DO THEY??? I only need one for '--game'

MUST verify the given values by each argument (none can be negative)...Except it checks out... atoi can't convert negative numbers
must check if faces = {6, 8, 10, 12, 20} tho..
--game prob should take as VALUE between: [dice*rolls, dice*rolls*faces];

for --game sum and --game stats I get the sum in 2 different methods... maybe I should only keep the get_vec_sum() from stats
